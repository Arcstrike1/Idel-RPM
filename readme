IDLE RPM

Idle RPM is an idle/clicker racing game inspired by Cookie Clicker, built for players who want something fun to grind in short bursts without committing hours to a full playthrough.
Upgrade your car, enter increasingly competitive races, and climb the motorsport ladder from grassroots leagues all the way to Formula 1.
